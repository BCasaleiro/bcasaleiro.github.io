## I'm an Artificial Intelligence Engineer

Since I was a child, I've always liked puzzles. In my last year of high school, I was introduced to a new kind of puzzle: Programming! I decided that's what I wanted to do for a living and I took my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Coimbra. During the first year, I joined JeKnowledge, a Junior Enterprise where I worked on several web development projects and developed a JavaScript library to simplify map creation using Google Maps. After a year I joined Stratio, a small startup applying machine learning to failure prediction in large automotive fleets where I developed for Android and the Web.

After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I moved to Lisbon to study Artificial Intelligence and took my Master's in Information Systems and Computer Engineering with a focus on algorithms and intelligent systems at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. During my Master's second year, I developed my thesis on Morphosyntactic Label Disambiguation for European Portuguese. I also joined muse.ai where I implemented pipelines for object recognition, OCR and action recognition, and their respective curation tools.

I'm now looking forward to more puzzles!
