        I've always liked puzzles and in my last high school year I was introduced
        to a new kind of puzzle, programming! I decided that's what I wanted to do
        for a living and I started studying Software Engineering at the University of
        Coimbra. In my first year I joined JeKnowledge, a Junior Enterprise where
        I created a small JavaScript library to make the creation of maps using Google
        Maps easier and also worked in other Web Development projects. In my second year
        I got an offer to work as a Web Developer at Stratio, a small startup based
        in Coimbra responsible for Traderline and now moving to intracity mobility
        projects where I developed for Android and the Web.

        I'm now taking my Masters degree in Algorithms and Intelligence Systems at TÃ©cnico
        in Lisbon and looking forward to more puzzles!
